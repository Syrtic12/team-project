# Team Project

Please keep this up-to-date with information about your project throughout the term.

The readme should include information such as:
- a summary of what your application is all about
- a list of the user stories, along with who is responsible for each one
- information about the API(s) that your project uses 
- screenshots or animations demonstrating current functionality

By keeping this README up-to-date,
your team will find it easier to prepare for the final presentation
at the end of the term.

Sushaan's Notes for the team:
Based on the current implmentation of the entities and data access object, the app object will contain a local copy of all the data which will be fetched from DB at the start, then any changes mades to the local copy should be synced back to the DB. This will make it easier to manage the data in the app without having to constantly query the DB.
